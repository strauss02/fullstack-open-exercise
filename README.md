## Task Instructions
Topics:
1. Nodejs
2. Express
3. Deployment
4. MongoDB


General Information:
This week we will repeat on the server side and use the open course FullStackOpen.
In addition, we will learn to use a database called MongoDB.
The class was divided into 10 groups and each group was assigned a team leader. Communication between lecturers and students will be conducted through team leaders.
Although the assignment will be carried out with the help of the group, the submission will be personal to each student.

Task:
https://fullstackopen.com/en/part3

Submission:
The course is divided into four parts. At the end of each part or at the end of each day (whichever comes first) update your submission.
Feel free to perform part A and B and read about part C. But know that a lecture on the subject of Mongo will arrive during the week and therefore it is recommended to wait and get help from it. 
We ask that the group represent the situation in which all its members stand. If one of the group members has difficulty with one of the topics, help him/her or contact the lecturer for further help (we will be happy to receive requests for help from you)

Have fun!
